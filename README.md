Project: Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum and marks my restart into learning web development. The goal of this project is to build a simple recipe website using basic HTML to practice structuring web pages with headings, lists, links, and images.

By completing this project, I aim to reinforce my understanding of:

HTML boilerplate and file structure

Creating and linking multiple pages

Using semantic HTML elements

Writing clean, readable markup
