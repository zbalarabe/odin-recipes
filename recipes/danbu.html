        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Dambu (or Dambou) is a popular, fluffy Hausa delicacy from Northern Nigeria, often described as rice couscous. It is made by steaming mixed grains—commonly rice (dambun shinkafa), maize (tsaki), or wheat—with moringa leaves (zogale), carrots, oil, and spices. It is a nutritious, steamed dish often served with oil, chili (yaji), or soups.</p>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Rice:</strong> Crush rice (basmati or rice grits) into small pieces, not powder. Wash the grits thoroughly until the water runs clear to remove excess starch, which prevents clumping.</li>
        <li><strong>Initial Steaming:</strong> Place the washed, soaked, and drained rice grits into a steaming pot (or a colander lined with cheesecloth/foil). Steam for 25 to 30 minutes until partially cooked.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Ingredients:</strong> Transfer the partially steamed rice to a bowl. Add washed moringa leaves (zogale), sliced onions, crushed peanuts (gyada), blended pepper, cooking oil, spices (curry, salt, and seasoning cubes). Mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Steaming:</strong> Return the mixture to the steamer. Steam for another 15 to 30 minutes until the rice is fully soft and the vegetables are cooked.</li>
        <li><strong>Final Touches:</strong> Mix in a little more oil if desired and serve hot with fried fish, meat, or pepper sauce.</li>
    </ol>
