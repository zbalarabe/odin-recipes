    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>First, you get the Dan wake flour which is readily available now. You get the flour and mix it with a little water to make a thick paste.</li>
       <li>When you are done with making the paste, boil water in a pot and proceed to the next level.</li>
